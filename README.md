# Pico-8 Lab

This is a collection of Pico-8 demos, techniques and tools that I've created or copied from other sources. I'm using this repository to keep track of my progress and to share my work with others.

## Demos

- [**Hello world**](https://radwan92.github.io/pico-lab/demos/hello-world/hello-world.html): A simple program with rolling "hello world" text.
- [**Player movement**](https://radwan92.github.io/pico-lab/demos/player-movement/player-movement.html): A simple program with a player that can move around the screen.
